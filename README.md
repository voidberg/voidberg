### Hi there 👋

I am the Director of Software Engineering at [Branded Entertainment Network](https://ben.productplacement.com), an amateur game developer, [lazy chiptune maker](https://soundcloud.com/viciosul_sid) and part time Mr. T impersonator.

From time to time I like to ride pig statues while pretending to be Bastian from Neverending Story.
